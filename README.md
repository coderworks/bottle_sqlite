# BottlePy with SQLite

This project is a creative combination of BottlePY functionality, SQLite3, and a sprinkle of CSS to get an 'old newspaper' feel.
It shows a table and has buttons to add, update and delete table items. All is placed on a single-page (SPA).

It features:
- Creation of complete database file with defined table on startup
- (SQLite) debug information brought to the page with "breaking news"
- SimpleTemplate syntax, Inline Expressions, and Embedded Python code to create a dynamic page layout
- Table sorting
- JS functions to show the 'messagebox', 'addbox', and 'editbox' with the click of a button
- JS function that reads a html table row to create a custom edit form 
- Basic Object Oriented SQLite API to separate Bottle from SQLite
- Database information like total rows, database disk size and total/free diskspace
